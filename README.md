Saruman is a material management tool where partners can reserve items from an inventory. There are 2 different roles: Inventory managers and partners. Inventory managers can add items to an inventory. They can create partners and assign reservable items to partners. Partners can follow a unique link to request items they can order.

At an event, they can pick up the items at a pit by scanning their own barcode with the barcode of the item.
